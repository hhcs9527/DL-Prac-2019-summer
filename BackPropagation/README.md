# What I do?
Most is about implement the basic but important skill in Deep Learning.

In back propagation, I realize how we really 'use' the gradient.

In Cross entropy, I realize the 'definition' of it, and know how to calculate it.
(This is copy from the reference, help realizing the idea of it.)
